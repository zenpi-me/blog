> Humans live on one-quarter of what they eat; on the other three-quarters lives their doctor. ~Inscription on an Egyptian pyramid

A view thousand years ago, humans began to settle down and started planting their food and domesticated animals. Before, they just enjoyed life, hunted and gathered. This was a nice time. People were fit and actually didn't work that much (compared to today). Obviously the technology was not very good and therefore, if you got sick or you hurt yourself somehow, this was very dangerous and even deadly often. Childbirth was also crazy dangerous for mother and child. People nowadays tend to think the humans 8000 years ago must have been so unhealthy but that's really not true. Back in the days humans were actually stronger and healthier than today. And if they didn't die from accidents or at birth, they often got quite old.

When we started with agriculture, it went downhill from there. People needed to work more for the field. No more strolling around but rather work on the farm! People got a lot more food, but sadly not in very huge variety. If you grow potatoes, I bet you ate quite a bit of potatoes in this family and hopefully some other stuff that you could trade with someone. But really... people were much worse off than before agriculture. At least health wise. People had more, but worse food and as a result became sick and fat.

Back in the days it was normal to not! eat very often. You were eating a huge meal every so often, if you were able to hunt down something for your tribe. And if not it was also fine. Did we need less back then? Why was that ok? If I don't eat for some hours I feel painfully hungry, right? Actually, wrong (I will explain!).

What about when you wake up in the morning? When was the last time you ate the day before? Maybe a late night snack at 10pm? Let's say you have breakfast at around 10 in the morning on the weekend. Then you were able to not eat for 12 hours! How is this possible without fainting from hunger? It's possible because the body can switch from getting his energy from carbohydrates to getting the energy from ketones. And this is perfectly healthy and natural and has been this way for thousands of years. Just recently the companies started making advertisements about how the breakfast is the most important meal of the day and that you should eat a lot to grow big and healthy. At least 3 meals a day, right? But besides marketing, this is actually not only bad advice but one of the most deadly ones out there...

When you look at statistics of causes of death, you will always see "Heart disease" on the very top and then stuff like "Stroke", "Alzheimer's" and "Diabetes" also in the top ten probably.

> And now let me tell you, why this is related to our life style

When we eat all day without giving the body a break, we will constantly raise our blood glucose or keep it on a high level. To tackle this, the body will create insulin and if that goes on for years on very high levels, the cells will become resistant to insulin and voila, you got Diabetes. What also happens with high blood glucose is, that your body will start storing energy into fat cells -> you get a little bit chubby :/

It sadly does not end there. Fat will not only make you.. not very attractive, it also makes you sick from the inside. Your heart will suffer from fat around it and also your veins are getting clogged from fat deposits. And the worst of it is that insulin does not allow your body to tap into your body fat for energy. So as soon as your blood glucose lowers, you will feel hunger and the cycle begins again -> This is why you might think, you absolutely need 3 meals a day.

The modern diet of eating 3 meals a day has nothing to do with our biological needs, but rather its a modern cultural thing that developed in modern times. But actually your body would not even need you to eat 1g of carbohydrates at all. The liver could produce as much as the body needs. But how do I eat less, if I get so hungry? How do I get into this Ketosis state?

### Fasting to the rescue!

Eating less does not mean, that you should just eat half your meal sizes and still eat 3 meals a day. If you would do that, you would end up really hungry and actually sick. That's because your body never fully depletes your glucose storage and therefore will not go into ketosis.

So what you do instead, is to eat in a smaller time frame. For example only 8 hours a day. If you manage to do that for a couple of days, your body will adapt to it and you will not feel hungry outside of these 8 hours. This is because, your body will finally have time to tap into your fat reserves and really heal itself. Meaning, your body will use the stored fat and use it for energy. Like when a hybrid car switches from gas to electric.

Not eating also takes your cells in a maintenance state, which is responsible for DNA repair and therefore for longevity. (Learn more about this from David Sinclair - for example in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRt7LjqJ45k&ab_channel=Veritasium) )

There are so many more benefits of fasting. But I cannot possibly list down everything in this one blog entry. One important thing is also that fasting has been linked to the prevention of neurodegenerative diseases. You can read about this everywhere...

What I really liked when researching this topic was the YouTube channel "What I've Learned" and especially these two videos (He can also explain this much better than I can):
