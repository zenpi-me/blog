### What even is true?

I learned to apply critical thinking on almost everything that I hear or read. Or I simply don't count it as a fact anymore, but just some temporary state of truth - until I hear something else.

You might say "oh, but I do that all the time!". You might be doing it and say that you even found research about it and it proves that this must be true, right? The thing is though, that a huge part of research is contradictory to other research or simply wrong.

I recently was listening to [this audiobook](https://smile.amazon.de/gp/product/B07Y2VXCND) called "Lies My Doctor Told Me: Medical Myths That Can Harm Your Health". Which is a great demonstration of what I mean. We are basing your knowledge on research that is maybe not well done, outdated or simply faked. The problem here is, at least for me, that our society is not very fast in adapting the latest research.

So when we say for 100 years, that A is good for you and everyone and their mother adapts it, writes songs about it and hears that from their doctor and from television. It must be true, right? But if now some researcher comes along and says that A is not really good but maybe causing a lot of trouble, he is probably going to be stoned to death or cancelled on twitter.

_So my recommendation is:_

1. Read this damn book
2. Adapt a scientific thinking where nothing is true until proven. Nothing is true just because the majority says so. Or because a popular person says so. Or even just because it vibes with your worldview.
3. Be brave and ask questions. You didn’t get why someone recommended this or that? Ask him politely why he thinks that. Joe Rogan does this really well. He laser focuses on the argument and if it doesn’t make sense or he senses bs, he will sure as hell ask questions.

Well that's it. Nothing to see here. Move along.
