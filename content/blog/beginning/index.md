One of the really important principles that I know and that should guide me through my life is "Begin with the end in mind". I got this from the book `7 habits of highly effective people` (one of the best books ever, really.) and just earlier today I was reminded of the power of this first principle.

Sometimes I have days, where I have so much time that I could focus on my own stuff and I could create something beautiful that would make the world better. I can follow my dreams and I am in a position, where I could do almost everything that I want. The problem is just.. what do I want?

So in the end I am just sitting in my room, thinking that I am wasting my time, because I don't even know, where to begin. I was reading to just start somewhere and learn from small projects and fail a few times. Just so you get more input and new perspectives. Sounds nice, and naturally I also have 99 unfinished projects... but I couldn't really focus on things that didn't really matter. So my motivation for small learning projects fades away pretty quickly.

But what matters to me?

> I think the most valuable thing that I got for the world might be the guide to let people wake up from the dream, that we call the mind.

So there it is. This is my personal thing that I would love to leave behind, when I am gone. Looking back at my life, when I am old, I would like to see that I at least tried to teach people one or two things about their mind. To make them free from the thoughts and fears that bind them to suffering.

Having this inner compass as a guide for decision making, is extremely powerful. It helps not only to decide, it also removes a lot of no brainer ideas that would just be a waste of time. If it does not help you to reach, what you really value, why pursuing it? This also saves you energy from decision fatigue, that you can put into important stuff. Of course you won't only have one value or goal that you follow in your life, so it's not always 1 or 0, but I think you get my drift.

In the book I mentioned above, you will follow the process to think about your own funeral (...I know right? damn). You can think about all the different areas of your life. All the people that can think about you when you're gone. And you can start imagine, what you wish they would remember you for. This might help you decide on what kind of values are important for you in the different areas of your life. Given that you care about what others think in the first place :)

## After the "what" comes the "how"

The next step would be to think about how I can walk the path to the goal that I set for myself?

I hope I can report this next..
